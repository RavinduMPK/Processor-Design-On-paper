# Custom Processor Design Project

Welcome to the repository for the Custom Processor Design Project. In this project, we delve into the creation of a custom processor for a high-speed Industry 4.0 compliant factory operation. The aim is to meet throughput requirements that off-the-shelf embedded processors cannot fulfill.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design a custom processor to be part of a System on Chip (SoC) for an embedded system in a high-speed factory environment. The processor is intended to operate without an operating system and will be programmed through assembly language code compiled from C language programs. Pipeline processing is employed to achieve the desired throughput.

## Processor Specifications

The processor specifications provided for this project include details about memory, registers, ALU, addressing modes, instruction set, and more. The following aspects are covered:

- Data Memory and Program Memory specifications
- Register file details including the Stack Pointer
- ALU and addressing modes
- Instruction set supporting arithmetic, control flow, load/store, and data transfer operations
- Instruction formats and their justifications
- Encoding scheme for opcodes
- Microarchitecture design approach: Hardwired or Microprogrammed
- Datapath design with functional elements and control signals
- Controller design for the chosen datapath architecture

## Project Components

- **Instructions and Formats**: A detailed list of required instructions, their formats, opcodes, operands, and their meanings.
- **Encoding Scheme**: Proposals for an opcode encoding scheme that ensures easy and efficient decoding of instructions.
- **Datapath Design**: A clear diagram depicting the datapath with functional components and control signals.
- **Microarchitecture Approach**: Explanation of the chosen microarchitecture approach (Hardwired or Microprogrammed) with justifications.
- **Controller Design**: Detailed design of the controller for the datapath, illustrating inputs, outputs, and reasons for design decisions.
